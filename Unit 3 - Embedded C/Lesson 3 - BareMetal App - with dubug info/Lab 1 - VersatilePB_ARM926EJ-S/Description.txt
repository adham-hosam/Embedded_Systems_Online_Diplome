Memory Region: You've defined a single memory region named MEM, starting at address 0x00000000 and having a length of 64M. This matches the memory layout for your VersatilePB platform.

Section Addresses: You've set the current address (. = 0x10000;) to specify the initial address for the sections. This address indicates where the program code starts in memory. This can be useful for loading the code to a specific address.

.startup Section: You've defined a .startup section to hold the code from startup.o. This section is placed at the beginning of memory (MEM) and is commonly used for the startup code.

stack_top: You've defined a stack_top symbol to mark the top of the stack. It's placed at the current address plus 0x1000. This provides some separation between code and the stack, which is a good practice to avoid accidental overwriting of the stack when the program is running.
